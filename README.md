# Visualizing and Predicting Heart Diseases with an Interactive Dashboard

## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes, are the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart diseases are crucial for effective intervention and prevention. This project, **"Visualizing and Predicting Heart Diseases with an Interactive Dashboard"**, leverages **advanced data visualization techniques** to provide insights into heart disease risks.

## Project Objectives
By the end of this project, we aim to:
- Develop an **interactive dashboard** for heart disease data visualization.
- Build **accurate predictive models** for heart disease risk assessment.
- Utilize **advanced visualization techniques** to uncover critical insights.
- Improve **accessibility and educational awareness** about heart disease risk factors.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides visual insights into heart disease risk factors using **Tableau**.
- **Comprehensive Visualizations:** Analyzes **age, gender, physical activity, lifestyle habits**, and their impact on heart disease.
- **Web Integration:** Dashboard is embedded into a **Flask-based web application** for seamless interaction.

## Project Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow to ensure accuracy and usability:
1. **Problem Definition:** Identifying the causes and impact of heart diseases (e.g., obesity, smoking, lifestyle factors).
2. **Data Collection:** Gathering data from medical records, patient demographics, and wearable health devices.
3. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, normalizing, and preprocessing the data for visualization and model training.
4. **Data Visualization:** Creating interactive visualizations to explore relationships between heart disease and various risk factors.
5. **Dashboard Development:** Embedding the visualizations in an **interactive Tableau dashboard** and integrating it with a web application.
6. **Performance Testing:** Ensuring the dashboard functions effectively with **large datasets and concurrent users**.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various health parameters such as:
- **Heart Disease (Target Variable)**
- **BMI, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Stroke History**
- **Physical & Mental Health, Age, Race, Sex**
- **Physical Activity Levels, Diabetic Status, Sleep Time**
- **Kidney Disease and other medical conditions**

## Visualizations
The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:
- **Gender vs. Heart Disease**
- **Age vs. Heart Disease**
- **Diabetic Status vs. Stroke Correlation**
- **Impact of Smoking and Alcohol on Heart Disease**
- **General Health vs. Heart Disease Risk**
- **Physical Activity vs. Heart Disease Likelihood**
- **Other interactive insights**

## Tools & Technologies
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Tableau:** For data visualization and interactive storytelling.
- **Flask:** For web application development and dashboard embedding.
- **SQL:** For efficient data storage and management.
- **Python (pandas, NumPy):** For data processing.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a powerful tool for both medical professionals and individuals, offering **data-driven insights** into heart disease risks. By combining **interactive dashboards and predictive analytics**, we aim to improve early detection and encourage proactive healthcare decisions.

üöÄ **Future Enhancements:**
- Integrating real-time health data from **wearable devices**.
- Enhancing predictive models with **deep learning techniques**.
- Expanding the dataset for **higher accuracy and broader applicability**.
