Visualizing and Predicting Heart Diseases with an Interactive Dashboard

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early identification and accurate prediction of heart diseases are critical for effective intervention and prevention. This project, "Visualizing and Predicting Heart Diseases with an Interactive Dashboard", addresses this challenge by combining advanced data visualization techniques, machine learning algorithms, and real-time health monitoring.


Project Objectives

By the end of this project, we aim to:
Develop an dashboard for heart disease data visualization.
Create accurate predictive models for heart diseases.
Utilize advanced data visualization techniques.
Enhance accessibility and provide educational resources.

Key Features:
Interactive Dashboard: Provides visual insights into heart disease risk factors using tools like Tableau.

Visualization: Engages users with interactive and responsive visualizations such as gender, age, physical activity, and their impacts on heart disease.

Project Flow
The project follows a structured workflow:

Problem Definition: Understand the impact of heart diseases and their causes (e.g., obesity, lifestyle, smoking).
Data Collection: Gather data from medical records, patient demographics, and wearable devices.
Data Preparation: Clean, normalize, and preprocess the data for visualization and model training.
Data Visualization: Develop interactive visualizations to explore the relationships between heart disease and various factors.
Dashboard Development: Embed the visualizations in an interactive dashboard using Flask and other web technologies.
Predictive Modeling: Create models to predict heart disease based on risk factors such as age, physical health, diabetes, and more.
Performance Testing: Ensure the dashboard performs well with large datasets and multiple users.

Dataset:

Heart Disease (target)
BMI, Smoking, Alcohol Drinking
Stroke, Physical and Mental Health
Age, Race, Sex, Physical Activity
Diabetic, Sleep Time, Kidney Disease, and others.
Visualizations

The dashboard contains the following visualizations:
Gender vs. Heart Disease
Age vs. Heart Disease
Diabetic vs. Stroke
Impact of Smoking and Alcohol on Heart Disease
General Health vs. Heart Disease
Physical Activity vs. Heart Disease, and more.

Tools & Technologies

Tableau: For data visualization and interactive storytelling.
Flask: For embedding the dashboard and web integration.
SQL: For storing and managing data.
